# THIS REPOSITORY IS *IF* I WANT TO MOVE TO VERCEL, MIGHT (PROBABLY) NOT.

# 👽 [My Personal Site!](https://littlepriceonu.com) (V2)

My Personal Site, Hosted Using Vercel and Made Using Tailwind & Typescript.

## 💭 Extras

Heres a few fun facts and such about my site,

### 🎶 Music Card
The music card on my site pulls directly from my [last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/littlepriceonu/library) using the last.fm API!
The color of the text in the music title is the most vibrant color pulled from the album image, using [`node-vibrant`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-vibrant)

### 🏷️ Discord Status
The status in the corner of my profile picture is pulled directly from my discord status using [Lanyard](https://lanyard.eggsy.xyz)! (huge shoutout to lanyard btw)

### 📺 Hosting
My site is hosted using [Vercel](https://vercel.com), I used to use AWS, and still love AWS, but Vercel is much *much* easier.
